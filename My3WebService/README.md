My3 Prepay for Android
=========================

This folder contains the J EE WebService source code. This WebService is used if the user enables the "intermediate server" in the android application. The published apk in the Google Play Store will point to secure.damienoreilly.org

This WebService project is specifically setup for an automated deployment on a Tomcat7 application server, but in reality the WAR can be deployed on any Servlet 3.0 compatible application server such as Apache Tomcat v7+, IBM WebSphere v8.0+, Jetty v8+, Jboss v7+ etc...
